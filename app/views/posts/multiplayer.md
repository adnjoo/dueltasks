# Introducing Multiplayer To-Dos in DuelTasks

We’re excited to unveil **Multiplayer To-Dos**—our latest feature designed to bring the power of collaboration to task management!

## How Multiplayer To-Dos Work

With this new feature, tackling your to-do list becomes a team effort. Here’s how it works:

1. **Invite Collaborators**: Select any task and invite people you want to work with. Everyone will have access to the task details, deadlines, and progress updates.
  
2. **Share Responsibility and Stay Accountable**: With your collaborators onboard, there’s a built-in sense of accountability. Tasks don’t just sit on your list—they’re on everyone’s radar.

## Why Multiplayer To-Dos?

We know that accountability is a huge factor in completing tasks. With Multiplayer To-Dos, you can harness the power of shared responsibility. No more going it alone—every collaborator shares the commitment to see the task through.
