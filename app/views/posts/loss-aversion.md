# The Science of Loss Aversion

According to Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's <a href="https://slooowdown.wordpress.com/2015/11/21/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman/" target="_blank">prospect theory</a>, people are wired to fear losses more than they enjoy gains. This means that the pain of losing $10 feels far more significant than the pleasure of gaining $10.

The idea is simple: if failing to complete a task means losing money, you‚Äôll be more likely to act.

You can visualize this with the following graph:

The curve shows that losses feel more painful than the equivalent amount of gains feel pleasurable.
