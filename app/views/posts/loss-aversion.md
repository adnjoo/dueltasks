# The Science of Loss Aversion

According to Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's [**prospect theory**](https://cfdm.jasoncollins.blog/prospect-theory), people are wired to fear losses more than they enjoy gains. This means that the pain of losing $10 feels far more significant than the pleasure of gaining $10. DuelTasks leverages this fear of loss to push you toward success. The idea is simple: if failing to complete a task means losing money, you’ll be more likely to act.

You can visualize this with the following graph:

The curve shows that losses feel more painful than the equivalent amount of gains feel pleasurable—exactly the kind of motivation DuelTasks taps into.
